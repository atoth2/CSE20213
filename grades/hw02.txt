Part 1 Factors: 14/15

* Good Comment and identation
* The program should print the numbers in ascending order (-1)
	- e.g factors for -2 should be printed as -2,-1,1,2
* You can for example handle the ordering by creating
  - start and end variables and using them as an index to iterate your loop  
  	
Part 2 Multiplication Table: 15/15

* Good Comment and your code would be more readable if you put more space between some of the lines (e.g when you start a loop)

GRADE: 29/30
